# Interactive Explainability Dashboards for AI Models (IXDAIM)
IXDs: Visual, real-time AI explainability. Interactive dashboards for transparent AI

Interactive Explainability Dashboards are visual, user-friendly web applications that help users explore and understand why AI models make certain predictions. These dashboards integrate multiple explainable AI (XAI) techniques – from feature attribution methods like SHAP and LIME to example-based and counterfactual explanations – into a unified interface. They often provide interactive charts, tables, and text that allow users to probe model behavior (e.g. adjust input features or query “what if” scenarios) in real time. The goal is to improve transparency and trust in AI systems across domains such as healthcare, finance, natural language processing (NLP), and image recognition, by making complex model decisions more interpretable. Below, we survey existing open-source projects and research efforts that have built such dashboards, highlight their features, and discuss practical challenges (e.g. performance, scalability, fidelity vs. interpretability trade-offs, data privacy, and integrating LLM-generated explanations).




Here is a comprehensive table listing the main **tools, research projects, and case studies** referenced in the explainability dashboard summary. It includes the name, type of source, short description, relevance, and a link where available:
