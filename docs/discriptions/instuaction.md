# Interactive Explainability Dashboards for AI Models

## Introduction

Interactive **Explainability Dashboards** are visual, user-friendly web applications that help users explore and understand **why AI models make certain predictions**. These dashboards integrate multiple **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques – from feature attribution methods like SHAP and LIME to example-based and counterfactual explanations – into a unified interface. They often provide interactive charts, tables, and text that allow users to probe model behavior (e.g. adjust input features or query *“what if”* scenarios) in real time. The goal is to improve transparency and trust in AI systems across domains such as healthcare, finance, natural language processing (NLP), and image recognition, by making complex model decisions more interpretable. Below, we survey existing open-source projects and research efforts that have built such dashboards, highlight their features, and discuss practical challenges (e.g. performance, scalability, fidelity vs. interpretability trade-offs, data privacy, and integrating LLM-generated explanations).

## Open-Source Dashboards with Feature Attribution

A common foundation for XAI dashboards is **feature attribution**, which quantifies each input feature’s influence on a model’s prediction. Many dashboards incorporate methods like **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** and **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to show feature importance:

* **ExplainerDashboard (Python/Plotly Dash)** – A popular open-source library that can generate a full Dash web app for any scikit-learn-compatible model. With just a few lines of code, users get interactive plots for **global feature importance** (e.g. SHAP summary bar charts, permutation importances) and **local explanations** (SHAP force plots for individual predictions). It also supports **partial dependence plots (PDPs)**, feature interaction effects, and even visualization of individual decision trees in an ensemble. An ExplainerDashboard can be customized or simplified – for example, a “Titanic Survival” demo provides tabs to explore SHAP values, what-if analysis, and performance metrics for a Random Forest classifier. This tool was used as a baseline in user studies, confirming its status as one of “the most popular open-source explainability dashboards”. *Tech:* Python, Plotly Dash; open-source on GitHub with MIT license.

* **Shapash** – An open-source Python library by MAIF that builds a **user-friendly dashboard** on top of SHAP or LIME explainers. Shapash provides clear visualizations with **explicit feature labels** and values, aimed at non-technical stakeholders. Its web app lets users toggle between **global and local explanations** easily. Key features include an “**identity card**” view summarizing all information for a selected sample, global feature importance plots, and a “picking samples” module that plots true vs. predicted values and allows filtering of instances (e.g. by certain feature ranges or prediction errors). Shapash also implements **explainability quality metrics** (stability, consistency, etc.) to evaluate the reliability of explanations. It can produce a standalone **HTML report** for model audit purposes. *Tech:* Python (Dash backend with a D3.js front-end); open-source (Apache-2.0).

* **ExplainX AI** – A framework that offers a “complete explainability dashboard” through a simple function call. ExplainX integrates multiple XAI techniques under one roof: global SHAP value plots, **what-if analysis** for individual instances, **partial dependence and feature interaction** plots, and cohort-based analysis for model performance. For example, after training a model, calling `explainx.ai(X_test, Y_test, model)` launches an interactive web app (local server) with these components. The dashboard supports both SHAP Kernel and Tree Explainers for different model types, and upcoming modules like surrogate decision trees and Anchors (rule-based explanations) are mentioned. *Tech:* Python (Flask/Plotly); open-source on GitHub.

* **ModelStudio (R/Shiny)** – Part of the R **DALEX** ecosystem, ModelStudio generates an interactive **serverless D3.js dashboard** for any ML model in R. It automates computation of various explanation plots at both the dataset level (global) and instance level (local) and arranges them into a multi-panel dashboard. For example, ModelStudio will display global feature importance, partial dependence profiles, and local break-down (Shapley-like) explanations for selected instances, with the ability to hover and highlight points. This allows R users to explore model behavior without manual plotting, and the resulting dashboard can be saved or shared easily (it’s just static HTML/JS). *Tech:* R, Shiny/D3; open-source (CRAN package).

* **Microsoft Responsible AI Dashboard** – Microsoft’s open-source **Responsible AI Toolbox** includes a modular dashboard that covers interpretability alongside fairness, error analysis, and counterfactuals. The **Interpretability** tab (driven by the `InterpretML` library) computes global and local explanations using SHAP (e.g. LightGBM + Tree SHAP). The dashboard is web-based and can be launched in Azure ML or locally; it visualizes feature importance, allows **cohort analysis** (comparing explanations across subsets of data), and lets users generate **counterfactual examples** interactively. *Tech:* Python (Dash) – part of the Responsible AI Toolbox on GitHub.

## Example-Based Explanations and Counterfactuals

Beyond feature importance, many dashboards provide **example-based explanations** – finding and displaying specific data points to shed light on a model’s behavior. This includes **nearest neighbor** examples (past cases similar to a query) and **counterfactual reasoning** (tweaking input features to see how the prediction changes):

* **What-If Tool (WIT)** – Developed by Google’s PAIR, WIT is an interactive toolkit (hosted in Jupyter or TensorBoard) that allows users to **probe a model with hypothetical inputs**. Users can select an individual data point and adjust its feature values via sliders to see how the model’s prediction and confidence would change – essentially performing counterfactual exploration. WIT also lets you find **nearest counterfactuals** in the dataset: e.g., it can highlight the closest data point that gets a different predicted outcome, helping illustrate decision boundaries. Additionally, it offers **dataset visualization** (like scatter plots colored by prediction), **performance slices**, and **fairness metrics** – all without any coding. *Tech:* JavaScript (built into TensorBoard or as a standalone HTML).

* **Interactive Counterfactual GUI (Orange Labs)** – Researchers have proposed dashboards dedicated to counterfactual explanations. Guyomard et al. (2023) present an interactive tool that, for any given tabular instance, computes a set of possible **counterfactual explanations** (minimal feature changes to alter the prediction). The UI then allows the user to explore these alternatives – for example, toggling between different counterfactual solutions along axes like *sparsity* (number of features changed) vs. *impact on prediction*. The tool was demonstrated on a customer retention (churn) dataset. Notably, it is *model-agnostic* and works with any counterfactual generation algorithm, visualizing the results in an intuitive way for end-users to answer “What would need to change for a different outcome?”.

* **ViCE – Visual Counterfactual Explanations** – ViCE is an interactive visual analytics tool (open-sourced by NYU VIS) that emphasizes **counterfactual generation** for each data point. For a selected instance, ViCE finds the minimal set of feature changes needed to flip the model’s output (using techniques like growing spheres or direct search). It then highlights these changes in a visual interface, and situates the instance in context of the dataset. For example, ViCE’s demo on a **credit approval dataset** shows the user their current application’s features, and what adjustments (e.g. “Income > \$50K” or “Debt-to-income ratio < 30%”) would have resulted in approval. Users can interactively explore different “what-if” scenarios, effectively seeing the model’s decision boundary. ViCE also provides a *full* mode that clusters and contextualizes instances based on their feature contributions, albeit with a performance cost on very large data. *Tech:* Python (with a GUI, possibly web-based); open-source (MIT).

* **Nearest Neighbors & Prototypical Examples:** Some dashboards (especially in NLP and vision) surface similar examples to help explain *why* a model might classify an input a certain way. For instance, the **Language Interpretability Tool (LIT)** by Google includes a module to find the nearest training examples (in embedding space) to a given text, to see if the model’s prediction was influenced by seeing similar text labeled a certain way. In image classification, one might retrieve the most similar images from each class for comparison. Open-source XAI libraries like **Alibi** (by Seldon) also offer *prototype* and *critic* example methods, which could be integrated into dashboards to show representative examples of each class or highlight outliers. Example-based explanations ground the model’s abstract feature attributions in concrete cases that domain experts can recognize (e.g. *“This loan was denied; here are past loan applicants with similar profiles – notice most of them also defaulted”*).

* **Counterfactual Fairness Dashboards:** In sensitive applications like finance and hiring, dashboards sometimes integrate counterfactual analysis for fairness. For example, the **Basis AI “Bedrock” demo** (an open-source credit risk dashboard) includes a **Fairness** tab alongside feature explainability. Users can select a *protected attribute* (like gender or race) and see metrics and plots that compare outcomes between groups. This often involves generating counterfactual scenarios – e.g., “Would this prediction change if the individual were of a different demographic?” – to detect bias. While fairness analysis is a broader topic, its inclusion in explainability dashboards emphasizes actionable insights: if a counterfactual differing only in a sensitive attribute changes the outcome, the dashboard can flag potential discrimination.

## Natural Language Explanations with LLMs

An emerging trend is to augment or replace charts and numbers with **natural language justifications**. Large language models (LLMs) can generate human-readable explanations, either by translating the technical explanation (feature weights, etc.) into plain English or by engaging in a Q\&A dialogue with the user. Two notable projects illustrate this:

* **TalkToModel (Stanford/Google Research)** – TalkToModel is a research prototype that turns an explainability dashboard into an **interactive dialogue agent**. Instead of clicking tabs and charts, the user literally *chats* with the model. For example, a user can ask: *“What are the most important features for this model’s predictions?”* or *“How would decreasing the glucose level by 10 affect the risk for a 55-year-old patient?”* – even follow up with *“How can I flip this prediction?”*. TalkToModel parses these natural language questions using an LLM (fine-tuned to translate questions into a predefined “explanation query language”), executes the appropriate computations (e.g. retrieve feature importance, run a counterfactual), and then **responds in natural language** with the findings. For instance, it might answer: *“BMI is the most important feature, and decreasing glucose by 10 would **lower** the predicted diabetes risk by 20%. To flip the prediction to negative, you’d likely need to reduce glucose even further or change other factors.”*. Under the hood, TalkToModel still uses traditional explainers (like SHAP for feature importances, or a what-if engine for counterfactuals), but the user sees only a smooth natural language experience. In a user study with healthcare professionals and ML practitioners, such an interface was preferred and led to more effective model understanding than a traditional point-and-click dashboard. *Tech:* Python back-end with LLM (T5 or GPT-3.5) for parsing and response generation; front-end is a text chat interface.

* **RIXA (Fraunhofer IOSB)** – RIXA stands for **Real-time Interactive eXplainable AI**, and it similarly combines XAI methods with an LLM-driven natural language interface. RIXA is described as a “natural language XAI dashboard” where an end-user (non-technical) can ask questions through a chat about an AI system’s decisions. The LLM powering the chat is constrained to ensure faithfulness: it does *not* answer freely from the model but uses **function calls to underlying explanation routines** and a knowledge base about the model. This design is important for reliability – the LLM effectively acts as a translator, not an independent storyteller. The functions might include retrieving feature importances, generating a description of a rule, or computing a counterfactual. Because the background knowledge and functions can be tailored per application, RIXA can support a wide range of use cases (from explaining an assembly line QA model to a threat detection system) by adjusting its “persona” and vocabulary. RIXA is motivated by European AI regulations requiring transparency to laypeople, aiming to produce *layperson-friendly explanations* from technical AI outputs. *(As of 2025, RIXA is a research project; details on open-source availability are limited, but it exemplifies the approach of LLM-based explanation.)*

* **Other NL Explanation Efforts:** Some traditional dashboards also include simple template-based natural language summaries. For example, **Shapash** can output a text interpretation of local explanations (e.g. “For this patient, high temperature and heart rate contributed to the infection risk”) in addition to charts. Likewise, the Microsoft Responsible AI dashboard can produce text descriptions of feature importance or error analysis by using pre-written templates filled with the model-specific details. The integration of fully generative LLMs goes further by allowing open-ended Q\&A. However, it raises new considerations (discussed below) around consistency and truthfulness of the generated justifications.

## Industry Case Studies and Applications

Explainability dashboards have been applied in various industries, often with domain-specific tweaks:

* **Healthcare:** In medical AI, dashboards help clinicians trust and adopt models. A 2024 study built a **personalized explainability dashboard** for a hospital infection risk model using SHAP. For each patient, the dashboard showed the predicted risk trajectory (7-day risk of infection) alongside the top contributing factors for that patient (local SHAP values). This allowed doctors to see *why* the model flagged a patient as high risk – e.g. “persistent fever and elevated heart rate increased risk” – and compare two patients side by side (one who got infected vs. one who didn’t). The dashboard provided key insights: it confirmed that the model’s top features aligned with clinical expectations (vital signs, recent infections, etc.) and helped clinicians understand each individual prediction in context. Another example is an **AIX360 Dash app for heart disease**: IBM researchers open-sourced a Dash dashboard for a heart disease prediction model that was inherently interpretable (a logistic rule model). The app visualized each patient’s risk factors, the learned rules (e.g. “if age>50 and ST\_Slope=Down then risk increases by X”), and allowed users to toggle patient features to see rule outcomes. These examples show that in healthcare, both global transparency (does the model align with medical knowledge?) and local accountability (explain *this* patient) are crucial. Dashboards facilitate both, and can even be used as **clinical decision support tools** if validated – though care must be taken to ensure explanations are accurate and do not mislead clinicians.

* **Finance:** Banking and insurance were early adopters of XAI dashboards due to regulatory pressure for **credit score explanations**. Many open-source demos use classic credit risk datasets. For instance, BasisAI’s **credit risk dashboard** (mentioned earlier) logs global SHAP feature importances (e.g. showing that “debt-to-income ratio” is the top predictor of default) and offers a UI to inspect **individual loan applicants**. A user can select a specific applicant from a test set and see a local explanation: which features pushed their score up or down, presented in a bar chart or waterfall. This dashboard also includes a fairness check (comparisons across demographic groups). Another advanced example is from **NVIDIA**, where researchers combined explainability with big data analytics for credit portfolios. They created an **interactive SHAP clustering dashboard**: after computing SHAP values for millions of loans, they used GPU-accelerated clustering to group loans with similar explanation patterns. The dashboard (built with Plotly) lets users **zoom in on a cluster** of loans and see the aggregate feature contributions for that segment. For example, one cluster might represent young borrowers with short credit history where *“age” and “credit length” are the main factors increasing default risk*, whereas another cluster of seasoned borrowers might have *“high loan amount” as the dominant risk factor*. By selecting clusters in the top plot, the bottom plot updates to show the feature attribution breakdown for that group. This helps risk managers identify **systematic patterns** – not just why one loan was denied, but groups of similar loans and their driving factors. It also scales to large datasets by leveraging GPUs. In summary, financial applications use dashboards to **justify decisions** to customers (e.g. adverse action notices), to audit models for bias, and to debug model behavior on different segments of borrowers.

* **NLP (Text Models):** Modern NLP models (like BERT or GPT-based classifiers) can be hard to interpret, but tools like **LIT (Language Interpretability Tool)** provide interactive insight. In LIT’s web app, for example, a user can type in a sentence and see which words are highlighted as most influential for the model’s prediction (via gradient or attention-based saliency maps). LIT also supports *datapoint comparison*: you can select two sentences (or two translations, etc.) and compare their internal model representations or outputs side by side. An example use case is analyzing an NLP toxicity detector – LIT would allow a user to test slight wording changes and see if the toxicity score changes (a form of counterfactual), find similar past examples (to see if the model’s training data had biases), and even project sentence embeddings to visualize clusters of sentences. Another interesting case study is using XAI dashboards for **chatbot or translation models**: researchers have built custom dashboards to trace model decisions in a translation system, highlighting which source words align to which target words and where the model is uncertain. While not as common as tabular dashboards, these illustrate that even complex sequence models can be made interpretable with thoughtful UI design.

* **Vision (Image Models):** Explainability dashboards for images often incorporate **visual saliency maps**. For example, **Captum Insights** (from PyTorch’s Captum library) provides an interactive widget for image models. A user can upload or select an image and Captum Insights will display the image with a heatmap overlay (e.g. using Integrated Gradients or Grad-CAM) to show which pixels or regions contributed most to the predicted class. It supports stepping through multiple images and can also visualize attributions for text models in a similar way (highlighting words). Research prototypes in this space include dashboards that let users adjust parts of an image (e.g. erase an object, change a color) to see if the classification changes – a true visual counterfactual. One example from literature used an interactive tool for **medical imaging** diagnosis where radiologists could click on sections of an X-ray and see the model’s confidence change (thus identifying which region influenced the diagnosis). In practice, image dashboards are less standardized, but when they exist, they need to handle large data (high-res images) and often focus on **uncertainty communication** – e.g. showing not just a single heatmap but also the model’s confidence interval or multiple plausible explanations. For instance, an image classifier might say: *“I’m 60% confident it’s a cat because of the ear shape highlight, but there’s 30% confidence it’s a fox focusing on the snout region”*. Communicating that uncertainty via visuals (multiple heatmaps or blur-out of uncertain regions) is an active area of research, as it can help users trust the model’s judgment appropriately.

## Technical and Practical Challenges

Building and deploying interactive XAI dashboards comes with several challenges:

* **Performance and Scalability:** Many explainability techniques are computationally heavy. Calculating SHAP values for large datasets or complex models can be slow – for example, Kernel SHAP requires many model evaluations and can **run for hours** on big data. Dashboards mitigate this by precomputing as much as possible (e.g. global SHAP on a background sample) and caching results. Some frameworks let you disable especially expensive features; ExplainerDashboard notes that **SHAP interaction values** (second-order effects) are “very slow to calculate” and are often turned off unless needed. Scalability solutions include using GPU acceleration (as in NVIDIA’s RAPIDS for clustering millions of SHAP points) or sampling data to manageable sizes. Still, there is a trade-off between interactivity and latency – a truly real-time “what-if” might require a fast approximation or a simpler surrogate model. In practice, many dashboards are deployed for **offline analysis or model validation** rather than for every single prediction on the fly (with exceptions like real-time credit decision explanations, which require optimizing for speed).

* **Integration with ML Pipelines:** To be useful, dashboards need to hook into models securely and easily. This means providing APIs or connectors. Tools like ExplainX and ExplainerDashboard have one-line functions to wrap a trained model and launch a local web server, which is great for a data scientist’s notebook. But deploying that in production might require containerization and authentication layers (since model explanation often involves sensitive data). Additionally, if the model is updated, the dashboard should update the explanations accordingly – requiring robust versioning and perhaps continuous integration of explainability metrics (some MLOps platforms now include “explainability monitoring” where each new model must produce an updated set of global explanations). The **Responsible AI Toolbox** being integrated into Azure ML Studio is one example of incorporating dashboards into the model development lifecycle.

* **Interpretability vs. Fidelity Trade-off:** There is an inherent tension between simplifying explanations for humans and capturing the true reasoning of a complex model. Dashboards sometimes offer **multiple explanation modes** to address this. For instance, a dashboard might show a simple *surrogate decision tree* as a global model summary (easy to interpret but not very faithful) alongside SHAP values which are more faithful but harder to parse. Some research (like TalkToModel) even automates choosing the most accurate explanation for a query by comparing their fidelities. LLM-generated explanations exacerbate this concern – an LLM might produce a very plausible-sounding reason that **was not actually used by the model** (hallucination). Ensuring fidelity, e.g. by constraining LLMs to use function outputs (as RIXA does), or by limiting them to summarizing existing attribution data, is critical. Users should be warned (perhaps via the dashboard UI) about which explanations are *approximate*. For example, **counterfactual examples** found by a genetic algorithm might not exactly lie on the data manifold, so while they change the prediction, they might be unrealistic – a dashboard should highlight that (some do this by showing a “feasibility” score or disallowing changes that violate data constraints).

* **Data Privacy:** Dashboards that show example cases or allow queries need to consider privacy, especially in domains like healthcare and finance. If a user queries *“Show me similar patients,”* the system might retrieve real patient records as examples – which could violate privacy if not handled properly. One approach is to **anonymize or aggregate** example-based explanations: e.g. show a prototypical synthetic example or summary statistics of a cluster rather than an actual individual’s data. Another risk is that LLMs trained on internal data might leak sensitive information when generating explanations. Organizations deploying such systems often restrict them to on-premise or carefully scrubbed data. Techniques like differential privacy for explainability are being studied (e.g. to provide explanations without exposing outlier data points). Also, an explanation itself can inadvertently expose model IP or data – for instance, showing the top 5 features for every prediction could allow someone to infer feature importance patterns and potentially reverse-engineer aspects of the model or dataset. Dashboard designers need to implement access control: perhaps only authorized analysts can see all details, whereas customers get a limited view (e.g. “Loan denied due to high debt-to-income ratio” – a single-sentence reason required by law, but not the full SHAP value breakdown of all features).

* **User Experience and Comprehensibility:** A beautifully engineered dashboard is futile if end users (who may not be ML experts) can’t understand the explanations. Thus, a lot of practical effort goes into the **design and wording** of explainability dashboards. Projects like Shapash emphasize using **human-friendly labels and units** for features (e.g. “Blood Pressure (mmHg) = High” instead of “feat\_12 = 1”). Some dashboards allow custom descriptions for features and model outputs to be provided, so the UI can display “Risk of diabetes (%)” instead of “Model output”. Moreover, combining multiple explanation types can confuse users – studies have found that users can be overwhelmed if, say, they see a SHAP plot, a counterfactual table, and a partial dependence graph all at once. One mitigation is to use a **wizard or guided experience**: e.g., the dashboard might start by showing a global overview (“These 3 features matter most overall”), then let the user drill down (“Select a feature to see details” or “Choose a specific prediction to explain further”). Tooltips, tutorials, or even integrated chatbot assistants can help interpret the visualizations. **Natural language generation** can also bridge the gap – for example, after showing a chart, a textbox might read: *“Figure: The model is most sensitive to Age; as Age increases, predicted risk increases (see partial dependence curve above).”* This kind of captioning is recommended to ensure insights are correctly understood. In summary, making the dashboard **usable and understandable** often requires iterative design with feedback from the target users (doctors, loan officers, etc.), and sometimes the “simplest” explanation (even if less precise) is the most effective for that audience.

* **Maintaining Interpretability under Model Updates:** If an AI model is retrained or updated, its explanations can change. A practical blocker is keeping the dashboard in sync with the latest model version. In regulated industries, one may need to archive the dashboard outputs for each model release (for audit) and ensure the new model’s dashboard is recalibrated. Automated testing of dashboards is another challenge – verifying that an explanation is correct is non-trivial. Some researchers propose **explanation consistency checks**: e.g., if nothing about the model changed significantly, the important features should not wildly fluctuate between versions (if they do, that may signal instability). Therefore, deploying these dashboards in production involves MLOps-style version control and validation of explanations.

Despite these challenges, the trend is clearly towards more **interactive, integrated, and intelligent** explainability tools. The combination of rich visuals, example-driven insights, and conversational interfaces is making it increasingly feasible for end-users to **trust and critically evaluate AI decisions** rather than accepting them as black boxes. As open-source projects continue to mature and incorporate research advances (like LLMs and novel visualization techniques), we can expect explainability dashboards to become standard components of AI systems in practice, much like monitoring dashboards are for software systems.

## Summary

Interactive explainability dashboards are powerful tools for demystifying AI models. Modern dashboards combine multiple techniques – **feature attribution** (SHAP, LIME, etc.) to quantify influences, **example-based explanations** to ground those insights in real cases, **counterfactual what-if analysis** to explore how changes affect outcomes, and even **natural language narratives** (increasingly via LLMs) to describe model reasoning in human terms. We surveyed a range of open-source projects and research prototypes across industries: from **healthcare** (explaining patient risk predictions with SHAP visualizations) and **finance** (credit risk dashboards with global feature importance and individual applicant explanations) to **NLP** (tools like LIT highlighting important words and similar examples) and **vision** (saliency map explorers for image models). These examples show that while the core principles are similar – help the user answer “Why did the model do that?” – the implementations are tailored to domain needs and data types.

Crucially, we discussed the **technical and practical hurdles** in building such systems. Performance bottlenecks (e.g. computing SHAP at scale) can be addressed with sampling, approximation, or hardware acceleration, but there’s a balance between interactivity and accuracy. The **fidelity of explanations** must be preserved even as we simplify them; otherwise, we risk misleading users with incorrect rationales. Integrating LLMs to produce explanations offers a natural, conversational experience, but must be done carefully (using constrained generations or verification) to maintain trustworthiness. **Scalability and security** considerations mean these dashboards are evolving from simple notebook tools to robust web applications that fit into enterprise ML workflows (with versioning, permission control, and monitoring of their own).

In conclusion, interactive XAI dashboards represent a significant step towards **human-centered AI**. By making model decisions transparent and allowing users to interrogate “what if” scenarios, they not only foster understanding but also enable stakeholders to catch errors, biases, or unfairness before AI systems are deployed. The open-source community has made many of these capabilities freely available – from general-purpose frameworks like ExplainerDashboard and Shapash to specialized research demos – lowering the barrier for organizations to adopt explainability. As AI models grow more complex (think ensembles of deep models or large language models), the importance of intuitive explainability will only increase. We can expect future dashboards to incorporate richer visual analytics (e.g. network graphs of feature interactions), better uncertainty indicators, and seamless natural language interaction, all while addressing the current challenges of speed, fidelity, and privacy. The end goal is that **any user, regardless of technical background, can interact with an AI system’s “thinking process”** – asking questions, exploring alternatives, and ultimately trusting the system with a well-founded understanding of its behavior.

**Sources:** The information above was synthesized from a variety of sources, including open-source documentation and research papers. Key references include the ExplainerDashboard docs, the Shapash project description, the TalkToModel nature article, the RIXA project page, NVIDIA’s credit risk blog, and several others as cited inline. These illustrate both the capabilities of current XAI dashboards and the lessons learned in implementing them.
